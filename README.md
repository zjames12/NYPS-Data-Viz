Mapping Crime in the City of New York

This project attempts to create an interactive map of crime in New York City.
It utilizes publicly available data.

Currently, the map only presents homicide data from 2016 and 2017. This will be expanded
to include other types of data.

All the crime data used for this project can be found at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/reports-landing.page
